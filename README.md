These are the core technologies used to create the user interface. HTML defines the structure, CSS styles the UI, and JavaScript adds interactivity. JavaScript is also responsible for establishing the connection to the server using Socket.IO on the client side.The Socket.IO client library (socket.io-client) is included in the front-end. It connects to the Socket.IO server and allows the browser to send and receive real-time messages. You can install it via npm or include it directly via CDN.Front-end frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular can be used to create a dynamic UI and manage state efficiently. For instance, React’s component-based structure works well with live updates.Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side. It’s non-blocking and event-driven, making it ideal for real-time applications like chat systems.Express is a lightweight web framework for Node.js. It handles HTTP requests, routing, and middleware. It’s often used alongside Socket.IO to serve web pages and manage API endpoints.This is the core technology for real-time communication. It uses WebSockets or falls back to HTTP long polling if needed. The server listens for events like user connections, disconnections, and message transmissions, and emits corresponding events to the clients.
